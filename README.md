# Quest Capture Client
The Quest Capture Client Unity App enables you to capture your device's camera feed along with various tracking data, and store it on a remote server.   

The Quest Capture server can be found here: [Quest Capture Server](https://github.com/stephanmitph/quest-capture-server). Follow the instructions to get your own instance running. Configure this server in the settings of the client app.

This client is still in development and manually tested. If you encounter any issues or bugs, please feel free to contribute!
