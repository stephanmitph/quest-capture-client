# Quest Capture Client
The Quest Capture Client Unity App enables you to capture your device's camera feed along with various tracking data, and store it on a remote server.   

The Quest Capture server can be found here: [Quest Capture Server](https://github.com/stephanmitph/quest-capture-server). Follow the instructions to get your own instance running. Configure this server in the settings of the client app.
